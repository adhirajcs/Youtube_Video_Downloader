# Youtube_Video_Downloader

Youtube_Video_Downloader is an application written in Python that allows users to download YouTube videos by providing a video link and selecting a desired video resolution. This script uses the Pytube library, a lightweight and easy-to-use library for downloading YouTube videos.

## Usage

To use the Youtube_Video_Downloader script(Youtube_Video_Downloader.py) or the Windows Application (Youtube_Video_Downloader.exe), follow these steps:

1. For the Python script, run the script in a Python environment. The script will prompt the user to enter a YouTube video link and select a desired resolution for the video download. Once the video is downloaded, the user can close the window.

   ```bash
   python Youtube_Video_Downloader.py
   ```

2. For the Windows Application, simply run the exe file by double clicking on it. The application will prompt the user to enter a YouTube video link and select a desired resolution for the video download. Once the video is downloaded, the user can close the window.

## Location of the Downloaded Videos

All the videos will be downloaded in the downloads folder. If there isn't a downloads folder available, the program will create one and save the downloaded videos in that folder.

1. Prompts the user to enter a YouTube video link.
2. Prompts the user to select a desired resolution for the video download (1080p, 720p, 480p, or 360p).
